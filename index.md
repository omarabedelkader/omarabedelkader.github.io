## Software

### PharoGPT
- LLM-based code assistant for the Pharo ecosystem, inspired by ChatGPT but specialized for Smalltalk/Pharo.
- Fine-tuned language models on Pharo codebases to overcome data scarcity and language-specific challenges.
- Designed end-to-end pipeline including data collection, model fine-tuning, evaluation, and deployment.
- Integrated directly into the Pharo IDE for interactive code generation and assistance.
- **GitHub Repository:** [PharoGPT] (https://github.com/omarabedelkader/PharoGPT)

### Pharo-Copilot
- Intelligent code completion and generation tool for Pharo, inspired by GitHub Copilot.

- **GitHub Repository:** [Pharo-Copilot](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/Pharo-Copilot)

### ChatPharo
- Live conversational interface between Pharo developers and Large Language Models.
- Enables interactive discussions with LLMs directly from the Pharo environment.
- Designed an open and extensible architecture to experiment with multiple LLM backends.
- Project leader with a team of more than 5 contributors.
- **GitHub Repository:** [ChatPharo](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/ChatPharo)

### INERIS-IA

- **GitHub Repository:** [INERIS-IA](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/INERIS-IA)


### Family Dynamics Analysis
- This project analyzes family dynamics in France using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).
- Leveraging data from the French national census, the study identifies patterns in family structures, single-parent households, childbearing decisions, and naturalization through marriage across five regional zones. 
- Using advanced data mining techniques, the project explores relationships between demographic variables such as marital status, household composition, and nationality, offering insights into the cultural and social trends shaping French households.

- **Paper:** https://github.com/omarabedelkader/FCA/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf  

### Real-Fake Face detection
- This project demonstrates the process of building and training a neural network for classification tasks using machine learning frameworks.
- Walks through data preprocessing, model architecture definition, training, evaluation, and visualization of results, providing insights into model performance and prediction accuracy.  
- **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/omarabedelkader/real-fake-detection

### EESMACF
- This project focuses on evaluating the effectiveness of two NLP models—SBERT (Sentence-BERT) and MiniLM—in classifying analogies using the FrameNet dataset. FrameNet is a rich semantic database that captures the meanings of lexical units within specific contexts called frames. 
- The objective is to identify valid and invalid analogies in FrameNet, leveraging the capabilities of SBERT and a fine-tuned MiniLM model. SBERT is used to create dense vector embeddings of sentences that retain semantic similarity, while MiniLM is trained and fine-tuned to classify analogies effectively. 
- The project found that MiniLM achieved an impressive 99% accuracy in distinguishing between valid and invalid analogies, outperforming SBERT, which had around 55% accuracy.

### DeGatto
- The "DeGatto" project is a sentiment analysis framework designed for e-commerce, specifically focusing on women’s apparel reviews. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which includes over 23,000 sentences and aspect-level annotations for material, size, design, and comfort, the project aims to support e-commerce businesses and customers by analyzing feedback at both the sentence and aspect levels. Various NLP, DL, and ML models were tested, including LSTM (BiLSTM), SVM, Logistic Regression, and Multinomial Naive Bayes, with BiLSTM achieving the best results in sentence-level analysis and LinearSVC performing well at aspect-level analysis. A visualization tool was developed using ReactJS and NodeJS, enabling users to view results as bar or pie charts. The project concluded that BiLSTM is the most suitable model for sentence-level sentiment analysis, while LinearSVC excels in aspect-level analysis, providing a robust framework for sentiment classification in e-commerce contexts.
