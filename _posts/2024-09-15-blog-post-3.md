Basics of Pharo

# 1. Basic Syntax

Pharo code consists primarily of message sends. All operations in Pharo are messages sent to objects, even things like arithmetic.

## Objects
Everything in Pharo is an object, including numbers, strings, booleans, classes, and even code blocks.

```
3 + 4    "Here, the object `3` is sent the message `+ 4`."
'Hello' size   "The string 'Hello' receives the message 'size'."
```

## Messages
Messages are of three kinds: unary, binary, and keyword messages.

- Unary Message: A message with no arguments.
``` 
3 factorial    "The number 3 receives the message 'factorial'."
'Hello' asUppercase   "Converts string to uppercase."
```

- Binary Message: A message that has a symbolic name and takes one argument.
```
3 + 4   "Sends the message '+' with the argument 4 to the object 3."
5 * 6   "Multiplies 5 and 6 by sending '*' message."
```

- Keyword Message: A message that has one or more named parts, each followed by an argument.
```
'Hello' at: 1 put: $J   "Replaces the first character with 'J'."
Rectangle origin: (0@0) extent: (100@100) 
```

## Message Precedence: 
Message sends follow the precedence:

Unary > Binary > Keyword You can override the precedence using parentheses.

```
3 factorial + 4   "Evaluates as (3 factorial) + 4."
(3 + 4) factorial  "Evaluates 3 + 4 first, then takes the factorial of the result."
```

# 2. Variables and Assignments
Variables are dynamically typed. To assign a value to a variable, use the `:=` symbol:

```
x := 5.      "Assigns 5 to x."
name := 'Pharo'.   "Assigns the string 'Pharo' to name."
```

Temporary Variables: Declared within a method or block using vertical bars `|`.

```
| tempVar |
tempVar := 42.
```

# 3. Collections
Pharo has several types of collections like arrays, ordered collections, and dictionaries.

|  | Pharo | Java |
|-----------|-----------|-----------|
| Array | `myArray := #(1 2 3 4 5).   "Creates an array with elements 1 to 5."` | `int[] myArray = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};` |
| Ordered Collection | `myCollection := OrderedCollection new.` <br> `myCollection add: 1; add: 2; add: 3.` | `import java.util.ArrayList;` <br> `import java.util.List;` <br> `List<Integer> myCollection = new ArrayList<>();` <br> `myCollection.add(1);` <br> `myCollection.add(2);` <br> `myCollection.add(3);` |
| Dictionnary | `myDict := Dictionary new.` <br>  `myDict at: 'name' put: 'Pharo'; at: 'age' put: 10.`| `import java.util.HashMap;` <br>  `import java.util.Map;` <br>  `Map<String, Object> myDict = new HashMap<>();` <br>  `myDict.put("name", "Pharo");` <br>  `myDict.put("age", 10);` |



# 4. Control Structures
Pharo's control structures are implemented through message sending, often using blocks.

## Conditional Statements: ifTrue:, ifFalse:, ifTrue:ifFalse:

`(x > 10) ifTrue: [ 'Greater than 10' ] ifFalse: [ 'Not greater' ].`

## Loops:

- `whileTrue:`: Repeats as long as the condition evaluates to true. `[x < 10] whileTrue: [ x := x + 1 ].`

- `to:do;` : Iterates over a range of numbers. `1 to: 5 do: [:i | Transcript show: i ].`

- Collection Iteration: `#(1 2 3 4) do: [:each | Transcript show: each ].`

# 5. Blocks and Closures
Blocks are anonymous functions or lambdas. They are delimited by square brackets and can take arguments.

```
square := [:x | x * x].  "Defines a block that squares a number."
result := square value: 5.   "Evaluates the block with 5, returns 25."
```

Blocks can also capture the environment, meaning they form closures.


# 6. Classes and Methods
Pharo is class-based, so everything is an instance of a class. To define a class:

```
Object subclass: MyClass [
   | instanceVariable1 instanceVariable2 |

   MyClass class >> newMethod [
      "class side method"
   ]

   MyClass >> instanceMethod [
      "instance side method"
   ]
]
```

## Class definition:

- `Object subclass: MyClass` creates a subclass `MyClass` of `Object`.
- `| instanceVariable1 instanceVariable2 |` declares two instance variables.

- Instance methods: Defined using MyClass >>.

```
MyClass >> greet [
   ^ 'Hello!'
]
```
 - Class methods: Defined with MyClass class >>.

```
MyClass class >> description [
   ^ 'This is MyClass.'
]
```
