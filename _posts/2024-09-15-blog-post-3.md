Basics of Pharo

1. Basic Syntax
======
Pharo code consists primarily of message sends. All operations in Pharo are messages sent to objects, even things like arithmetic.

## Objects
Everything in Pharo is an object, including numbers, strings, booleans, classes, and even code blocks.

```
3 + 4    "Here, the object `3` is sent the message `+ 4`."
'Hello' size   "The string 'Hello' receives the message 'size'."
```

## Messages
Messages are of three kinds: unary, binary, and keyword messages.

- Unary Message: A message with no arguments.
``` 
3 factorial    "The number 3 receives the message 'factorial'."
'Hello' asUppercase   "Converts string to uppercase."
```

- Binary Message: A message that has a symbolic name and takes one argument.
```
3 + 4   "Sends the message '+' with the argument 4 to the object 3."
5 * 6   "Multiplies 5 and 6 by sending '*' message."
```


- Keyword Message: A message that has one or more named parts, each followed by an argument.
```
'Hello' at: 1 put: $J   "Replaces the first character with 'J'."
Rectangle origin: (0@0) extent: (100@100) 
```
