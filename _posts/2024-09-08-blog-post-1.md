Basics of the syntax of Pharo

Everything is an object
======
Everything is an object: Numbers, strings, and even control structures are objects.
Message Passing: Pharo uses message passing for method calls. For example:
`'Hello, Pharo' asUppercase.`  ==> `'HELLO, PHARO'"`

Variables and Methods
======
Define variables and create methods in Pharo classes. Try exploring the object model:
`Object new.` creates a new object"
