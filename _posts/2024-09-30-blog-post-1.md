Starting with Pharo is an exciting journey, especially if you’re diving into dynamic languages and live programming. Here’s a beginner-friendly guide to get you started:

Step 1: Install Pharo
======
1. Download Pharo: Go to pharo.org and download the latest stable version of Pharo for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Installation: Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform. Once installed, you’ll have both the Pharo VM and the image (where the actual code and environment are).


Step 2: Pharo Basics
======
Pharo uses an image-based model where the whole environment is saved and loaded. You’ll be working with:

1. Image: A snapshot of your system, containing all your objects, code, and state.
2. Virtual Machine (VM): Executes the code in your image.
3. Changes File: Tracks changes you make during your coding sessions.
