Pharo Playground

Step 1: Pharo Playground (Workspace)
======
1. Download Pharo: Go to pharo.org and download the latest stable version of Pharo for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Installation: Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform. Once installed, youâ€™ll have both the Pharo VM and the image (where the actual code and environment are).


Step 2: Pharo Basics
======
1. Open the Transcript: In macOS, use the command `Cmd + O + T` to open the Transcript. The Transcript is where the results of executed code are displayed.
2. Open Playground: The Playground is where you write and execute Pharo code. To open it, in macOS, use the command `Cmd + O + P`.
3. Write Some Code: In the Playground, try entering basic Smalltalk/Pharo code: `Transcript show: 3+4.`
4. Execute the Code: Highlight the code you just wrote and press `Do it` in the top left in Playground. This will evaluate the expression, and you should see `7` as the result.
