Starting with Pharo is an exciting journey, especially if you’re diving into dynamic languages and live programming. Here’s a beginner-friendly guide to get you started:

Step 1: Pharo Playground (Workspace)
======
1. Download Pharo: Go to pharo.org and download the latest stable version of Pharo for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
2. Installation: Follow the installation instructions provided for your platform. Once installed, you’ll have both the Pharo VM and the image (where the actual code and environment are).


Step 2: Pharo Basics
======
1. Open Playground: The Playground is where you write and execute Pharo code. To open it, click on the World Menu (right-click on the desktop) and select Playground.
2. Try Some Code: In the Playground, write some basic Smalltalk/Pharo code:
`3 + 4.`
3. Highlight the code and press Cmd + D (macOS) or Ctrl + D (Windows/Linux) to Do It (evaluate the expression). You should see `7` in the result pane.
