Messages

1. Only Objects and Messages in Pharo:
In Pharo, code exclusively manipulates objects like mouse, booleans, arrays, numbers, strings, windows, etc.
Actions in Pharo are done through messages and assignments.
2. Equivalence between Java and Pharo:
In Java:

java
Copy code
ArrayList<String> strings = new ArrayList<String>();
In Pharo:

strings := OrderedCollection new.
Key differences: Pharo does not have static typing or generics, and the new operation is a message sent to a class.
In Java (Threads):

java
Copy code
Thread regThread = new Thread(
    new Runnable() {
        @Override
        public void run() {
            this.doSomething();
        }
    }
);
regThread.start();
In Pharo:

smalltalk
Copy code
[ self doSomething ] fork
3. Message Types in Pharo:
Unary:
smalltalk
Copy code
5 factorial
Transcript cr
Binary:
smalltalk
Copy code
3 + 4
5 -> 10
Keyword-based:
smalltalk
Copy code
Transcript show: 'hello world'.
2 between: 0 and: 5.
4. Keyword Messages for Java Developers:
In Java:
java
Copy code
postman.send(mail, recipient);
In Pharo:
smalltalk
Copy code
postman send: mail to: recipient
The message is named send:to:, sent to postman with two arguments (mail and recipient).
5. Conditionals in Pharo:
In Java, conditional constructs like if, else, for, etc., are language keywords.
In Pharo, these are messages:
smalltalk
Copy code
fullName isEmpty
ifTrue: [ 'FirstnameLastname' ]
ifFalse: [ fullName ]
6. Loops in Pharo:
Loops are also messages:
smalltalk
Copy code
4 timesRepeat: [ self doSomething ].
0 to: 100 do: [ :i | ... ].
aCollection do: [ :each | ... ].
7. Summary:
Three types of messages: unary, binary, and keyword-based.
Conditionals and loops are just messages in Pharo.
The document emphasizes that Pharo, unlike Java, treats control structures like conditionals and loops as messages. Everything revolves around sending messages to objects. The syntax of keyword messages in Pharo is also highlighted as different from the method calling style in Java.

This guide seems to help Java programmers understand how to approach Pharo's object-oriented message-passing paradigm.
