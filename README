# omarabedelkader.github.io

This repository builds and publishes a personal academic website and CVs.

## What is happening here?

The project uses **Markdown sources** plus a small **Python + Pandoc build pipeline**:

- `sources/` contains the content (`site.md`, `cv.md`, `cv-industry.md`, `teaching.md`).
- `build/` contains Python scripts that convert Markdown into:
  - `docs/index.html` (website page for GitHub Pages)
  - `cv/cv-en.pdf` and `cv/cv-industry.pdf` (PDF CV outputs)
- `templates/` contains the website static assets (`style.css`, `main.js`, `header.html`, favicon).
- `resources/` contains citation and LaTeX support files (`publications.bib`, `apa.csl`, `header.tex`).
- `runner/` contains shell wrappers that set up a virtual environment, install dependencies, and run each build script.

## Build flow

- `run.sh` runs every script in `runner/`.
- Each runner script:
  1. Creates/activates `.venv`
  2. Installs `requirements.txt`
  3. Runs one Python build script from `build/`

The website build copies CSS/JS/favicon into `docs/`, converts `sources/site.md` to HTML, injects a footer with a "Last updated" label, and includes the client-side script.

## How to run

```bash
# run all build steps
bash run.sh
```

Or run individual targets:

```bash
bash runner/build-site.sh
bash runner/build-cv.sh
bash runner/build-industry.sh
```

## Deployment model

`docs/` is the publishable site directory for **GitHub Pages**.

So the normal edit cycle is:
1. Update content in `sources/` (and optionally templates/resources)
2. Rebuild
3. Commit generated output (`docs/`, `cv/`) and source changes
4. Push to GitHub

If you just want to update text/content, start with `sources/site.md` and rebuild.
