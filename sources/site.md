## Experience

### AI Researcher — INRIA (Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France)  
- *Oct. 2024 – Oct. 2027*  
- Improving code completion and code generation using LLMs, specifically targeting the Pharo programming language, which has limited training data.
- Developing techniques for code completion, type inference, and deployment in Pharo’s IDE, with a focus on runtime performance.

### AI Engineer — INERIS (Verneuil-en-Halatte, France)  
- *Sept. 2023 – Sept. 2024*  
- Developed “INERIS-IA,” a tool to classify textual documents according to INERIS’s strategic goals using ML and NLP techniques.
- Created Boolean queries for document retrieval and improved corpus quality through document similarity and keyword extraction.

### Intern — LIPN (Villetaneuse, France)  
- *June 2023 – Aug. 2023*  
- Compared sampling techniques for probabilistic planning, particularly for generating literary narratives.
- Evaluated methods including the Score Function Estimator (SFE) and advanced techniques such as Gumbel-Softmax, assessing their effectiveness in producing coherent and creative stories.

### Software Developer — BEON-IT (Beirut, Lebanon)  
- *May 2022 – June 2022*  
- Java · Design Patterns · .NET Framework · Threading · Microsoft SQL Server
