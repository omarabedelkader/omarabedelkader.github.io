- Leveraged LLMs to improve developer productivity in a dynamically typed language.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Pharo-Copilot](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/Pharo-Copilot)

### ChatPharo
- Live conversational interface between Pharo developers and large language models.
- Enables interactive discussions with LLMs directly from the Pharo environment.
- Designed an open and extensible architecture to experiment with multiple LLM backends.
- **GitHub Repository:** [ChatPharo](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/ChatPharo)

### INERIS-IA

- Trained document classification models aligned with COP 2027 objectives and INERIS strategic themes.
- Implemented additional features including document similarity, keyword extraction, and corpus quality improvement.
- **GitHub Repository:** [INERIS-IA](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/INERIS-IA)

### Family Dynamics Analysis
- This project analyzes family dynamics in France using Formal Concept Analysis (FCA).
- Using data from the French national census, the study identifies patterns in family structures, single-parent households, childbearing decisions, and naturalization through marriage across five regional zones.
- The project explores relationships between demographic variables such as marital status, household composition, and nationality, offering insights into cultural and social trends shaping French households.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Family Dynamics Analysis](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/FCA)
- **Paper:** [PDF](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/FCA/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)

### Real–Fake Face Detection
- Demonstrates the process of building and training a neural network for classification tasks.
- Walks through data preprocessing, model architecture design, training, evaluation, and visualization of results to assess performance and prediction accuracy.
- **GitHub Repository:** [real-fake-detection](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/real-fake-detection)

### EESMACF
- Evaluates two NLP models—SBERT (Sentence-BERT) and MiniLM—for classifying analogies using the FrameNet dataset.
- The objective is to identify valid and invalid analogies by leveraging SBERT embeddings and a fine-tuned MiniLM classifier.
- MiniLM achieved 99% accuracy in distinguishing valid from invalid analogies, outperforming SBERT (~55% accuracy).
- **GitHub Repository:** [EESMACF](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/EESMACF)
- **Paper:** [PDF](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/EESMACF/blob/main/paper/paper.pdf)

### DeGatto
- Sentiment analysis framework for e-commerce women’s apparel reviews.
- Uses a Kaggle dataset (23,000+ sentences) with aspect-level annotations for material, size, design, and comfort.
- Evaluated multiple NLP/DL/ML models (BiLSTM, SVM, Logistic Regression, Multinomial Naive Bayes). BiLSTM performed best for sentence-level analysis, and LinearSVC performed well for aspect-level analysis.
- Includes a visualization tool built with ReactJS and NodeJS to display results as bar or pie charts.
- **GitHub Repository:** [DeGatto](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/DeGatto)
- **Paper:** [PDF](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/DeGatto/blob/main/paper/DeGatto.pdf)
