## Summary

I am an AI researcher with extensive experience in artificial intelligence and software engineering. I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science at the University of Lille. ---


## Experience

**AI Researcher** — INRIA (Villeneuve-d'Ascq, France)
*Oct. 2024 – Oct. 2027*
- Improving code completion and code generation using LLMs, specifically targeting the Pharo programming language, which has limited training data.
- Developing techniques for code completion, type inference, and deployment in Pharo’s IDE, with a focus on runtime performance.

**AI Engineer** — INERIS (Verneuil-en-Halatte, France)
*Sept. 2023 – Sept. 2024*
- Developed “INERIS-IA,” a tool to classify textual documents according to INERIS’s strategic goals using ML and NLP techniques.
- Created Boolean queries for document retrieval and improved corpus quality through document similarity and keyword extraction.


## Projects

### Pharo-Copilot
- Intelligent code completion and generation tool for Pharo, inspired by GitHub Copilot.
- Focused on repository and package -level code completion.
- Leveraged LLMs to improve developer productivity in a dynamically typed language.
- **GitHub Repository:** [Pharo-Copilot](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/Pharo-Copilot)

### ChatPharo
- Live conversational interface between Pharo developers and large language models.
- Enables interactive discussions with LLMs directly from the Pharo environment.
- Designed an open and extensible architecture to experiment with multiple LLM backends.
- **GitHub Repository:** [ChatPharo](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/ChatPharo)

### INERIS-IA
- AI platform developed at INERIS for document classification and knowledge management.
- Built a Flask-based web interface integrating multiple ML and NLP models.
- Trained document classification models aligned with COP 2027 objectives and INERIS strategic themes.
- **GitHub Repository:** [INERIS-IA](https://github.com/omarabedelkader/INERIS-IA)


## Leadership & Community

- Founder of the Organization **Pharo-LLM**
- Member of the Organizing Committee, GDR-GPL'26
