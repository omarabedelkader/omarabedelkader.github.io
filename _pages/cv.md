Education
======
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, University of Lille, Lille, France, 2024-2027
* M.Sc. in Natural Language Processing, University of Lorraine, Nancy, France, 2022-2024
* B.Sc. in Data Science, Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon, 2019-2022


Work experience
======
* October 2024 - September 2027: AI Researcher
  * INRIA, Villeneuve-d'Asq, France
  * Duties include: LLM, Software Engineer, Pharo
  * Description: My role focuses on improving code completion and generation using LLMs, specifically targeting the Pharo programming language, which has limited training data. The project involves developing techniques for code completion, type inference, and deployment in Pharoâ€™s IDE, with a focus on runtime performance.

* August 2023 - September 2024: AI Engineer
  * INERIS, Verneuil-en-Halatte, France
  * Duties include: Machine Learning, NLP, Software Engineer
  * Description: My role focuses on developing "INERIS-IA," a tool to classify textual documents based on INERIS's strategic goals using machine learning and natural language processing techniques. Two experiments were conducted: the first used boolean queries for document retrieval, and the second improved corpus quality through document similarity and keyword extraction. The findings show that combining machine learning with human validation significantly improves accuracy while reducing the workload in document classification.

* June 2023 - August 2023: Intern
  * LIPN - Sorbonne University, Villetaneuse, France
  * Duties included: Generative Models, Applied Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning
  * Description: My role focuses on the comparison of various sampling techniques for probabilistic planning, particularly in generating literary narratives. This internship evaluates different methods, including the Score Function Estimator (SFE) and more advanced techniques like Gumbel-Softmax, to assess their effectiveness in creating coherent and creative stories. The conclusion is the development of a prototype model using a discrete VAE (Variational Autoencoder) to generate literary narratives, demonstrating the feasibility and potential of integrating these methodologies into the creative process.
