# Hello World ! in Pharo

1. Open the Transcript: In macOS, use the command `Cmd + O + T` to open the Transcript. The Transcript is where the results of executed code are displayed.

2. Open Playground: The Playground is where you write and execute Pharo code. To open it, in macOS, use the command `Cmd + O + P`.

3. Write Some Code: In the Playground, try entering basic Pharo code: `Transcript show: Hello World !.` Or `Transcript show: 'Hello, World !'; cr.`

4. Execute the Code: Highlight the code you just wrote and press `Do it` in the top left in Playground. This will evaluate the expression, and you should see `7` as the result.

Another Example: Summation of two numbers in Pharo
```
| a b sum | "Defining Varibales"
a := 5. "Assinging 5 to the variable a"
b := 10. "Assinging 10 to the variable a"

sum := a + b. "Summation of two numbers"

Transcript show: 'The sum of ', a asString, ' and ', b asString, ' is: ', sum asString; cr. "Show the result"

```
